The purpose of this file is to demonstrate that gitpages will natively serve a MarkDown index page.  From the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site):
> Create the entry file for your site. GitHub Pages will look for an index.html, index.md, or README.md file as the entry file for your site.
